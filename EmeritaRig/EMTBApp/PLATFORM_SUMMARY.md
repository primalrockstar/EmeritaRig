### **Revenue Projections:**

**Conservative Scenario (Year 1):**
- 500 active subscribers
- 60% Monthly ($24.99) = 300 × $24.99 = $7,497/month
- 40% Semester ($79.99) = 200 × $79.99 = $15,998 one-time
- **Monthly Recurring:** $7,497
- **Annual Run Rate:** $89,964 + $15,998 = **$105,962**

**Moderate Scenario (Year 2):**
- 2,500 active subscribers
- 50% Monthly = 1,250 × $24.99 = $31,237/month
- 50% Semester = 1,250 × $79.99 = $99,987 one-time
- **Monthly Recurring:** $31,237
- **Annual Run Rate:** $374,844 + $99,987 = **$474,831**

**Aggressive Scenario (Year 3):**
- 10,000 active subscribers
- 40% Monthly = 4,000 × $24.99 = $99,960/month
- 60% Semester = 6,000 × $79.99 = $479,940 one-time
- **Monthly Recurring:** $99,960
- **Annual Run Rate:** $1,199,520 + $479,940 = **$1,679,460**

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
- ~70,000 EMT-B students certified annually (USA)
- Even 1% market share = 700 students × $80 avg = $56,000/year
- 10% market share = 7,000 students = **$560,000/year**
