## ⚠️ **REMAINING PRIORITIES**

### 🟡 **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT** (Blocking)
**Issue**: Node.js not installed - preventing development server
**Impact**: Cannot test or develop locally  
**Solution**: Install Node.js LTS version
```bash
# Recommended installation methods:
# 1. Download from nodejs.org
# 2. Use Homebrew: brew install node
# 3. Use nvm: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```

### 🟡 **FILE SYSTEM CLEANUP** (Maintenance)
**Issue**: 82 backup files cluttering workspace
**Impact**: Developer confusion, slower navigation
**Solution**: Clean backup files (preserve recent backups only)
```bash
# Safe cleanup commands:
find . -name "*.backup-20250808*" -delete  # Old backups
find . -name "*-backup.tsx" -type f -mtime +7 -delete  # Week-old backups
```

### 🟡 **QUIZ SYSTEM EXPANSION** (Enhancement)
**Issue**: Balanced quiz system only has Chapter 1 implemented
**Impact**: Limited comprehensive assessment capability
**Solution**: Phased expansion
- **Phase 1**: Complete Module 1 (chapters 2-4) = +45 questions
- **Phase 2**: High-priority modules (5-10) = +90 questions
- **Phase 3**: Complete curriculum = +480 questions
